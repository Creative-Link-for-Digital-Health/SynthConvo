Destiny is a sixteen-year-old female who arrived for her weekly outpatient therapy session appearing tired and irritable. She slouched in the waiting room chair, scrolling on her phone until called back, and made minimal eye contact during the initial check-in. When prompted, Destiny shared that she had skipped most of her classes that week, spending time at a friend’s house instead. She explained feeling “bored” and “done with school” after being told she might have to repeat the year due to excessive absences.

Destiny has been in the foster care system since age nine, when she and her two younger siblings were removed from their biological parents due to chronic neglect and unsafe living conditions. After several placement changes, she has been living with her current foster family for nearly two years. While the placement is stable, her foster parents report ongoing struggles with curfew violations, truancy, and disengagement from family activities.

Destiny has a history of oppositional defiant disorder and mild depression. She has been in therapy for the past year, primarily working on emotional regulation, decision-making, and school engagement. Her attendance at sessions has been consistent, and she occasionally brings in creative writing pieces to share, though she resists deeper discussions about her long-term goals.

Academically, Destiny attends a large public high school but often skips classes she finds “pointless.” She enjoys English and art but struggles in math and science, which contributes to her frustration with school. Her teachers note she is capable of passing her courses when she applies herself but often avoids assignments altogether. She maintains a small group of close friends, most of whom are also inconsistent in school attendance.

Destiny’s foster parents describe her as independent and resourceful, though they worry about her lack of interest in planning for the future. In therapy, she responds best to collaborative problem-solving and opportunities to connect her personal interests—particularly poetry and spoken word—to her academic requirements. Her treatment plan focuses on improving school engagement, fostering healthy peer relationships, and building skills for independent living.
