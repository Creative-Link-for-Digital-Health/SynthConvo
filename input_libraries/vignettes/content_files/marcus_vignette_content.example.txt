Marcus is a fifteen-year-old male who was admitted to the psychiatric unit following an incident at his foster home. He was found by his foster mother attempting to overdose on prescription medication after receiving news that his contact visits with his biological sister would be suspended. When confronted, Marcus became verbally aggressive and threw objects around his room before barricading himself inside. His foster parents contacted emergency services, and Marcus was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Marcus presents as withdrawn and emotionally volatile, with a tendency toward dramatic gestures when feeling abandoned or rejected.

Marcus has been in the foster care system since age eight. He and his younger sister were removed from their biological home due to severe neglect and physical abuse by their mother's boyfriend. Their biological mother struggled with substance abuse and was deemed unable to provide adequate care. Marcus has lived in four different foster placements over the past seven years, with his current placement being the most stable. His current foster parents are experienced caregivers who have fostered multiple children over the past decade.

Marcus has experienced significant mental health challenges for approximately five years. This marks his second psychiatric hospitalization, with the previous admission occurring eighteen months ago following a similar crisis involving fears of placement disruption. Marcus typically exhibits mood instability and anxiety, particularly around themes of abandonment and separation. He demonstrates periods of intense anger and despair, often triggered by changes in his living situation or relationships. Despite these challenges, Marcus has shown remarkable resilience during stable periods, sometimes going several weeks with minimal symptoms when his environment remains consistent.

Academically, Marcus attends a therapeutic day school designed for students with emotional and behavioral needs. Within this structured environment, he performs at grade level in most subjects and has developed a particular interest in digital media and computer programming. He has formed positive relationships with several staff members and participates in the school's peer mentoring program. Marcus has two close friendships with classmates who share similar backgrounds. His current crisis was precipitated by learning that his sister's foster placement was experiencing difficulties, leading to a temporary suspension of their monthly visits while her situation stabilized.

Marcus's current foster family consists of experienced foster parents who have been married for twenty-two years. They maintain an active lifestyle and are involved in their local community center's youth programs. Marcus participates in a weekly robotics club and has expressed interest in pursuing computer science or game design after high school. The family also includes another foster child, a twelve-year-old girl who has been with them for two years. Marcus has developed a protective relationship with her, often helping with homework and teaching her computer skills. The foster parents work closely with Marcus's treatment team and attend regular therapy sessions focused on trauma-informed parenting strategies.
